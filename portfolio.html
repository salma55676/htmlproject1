            <p>I’m a passionate and detail-oriented web developer who believes technology should be simple, elegant, and useful. 
I love turning ideas into interactive websites that people can actually enjoy using. 
With a strong foundation in front-end development, I’ve worked on projects ranging from small personal apps to full websites for businesses. 
I’m constantly learning new tools and approaches to stay up-to-date in the ever-changing world of web development.

<section id="about">
    <h2>About me</h2>
<p>My name is Emily Carter, and I’m a junior web developer with a background in computer science and a passion for creative problem solving. 
    I first discovered coding during high school and quickly fell in love with the way a few lines of code could turn into something interactive on the screen. 
    Since then, I’ve worked on developing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while also exploring other languages and tools that make the web more dynamic and exciting. 
  </p>
  <p>Beyond just writing code, I’m deeply interested in how design and functionality come together. 
    I believe that a successful website isn’t only about looking good, but also about creating a smooth, enjoyable experience for the user. 
    That’s why I spend time sketching out ideas, experimenting with layouts, and researching best practices for usability. 
    In my free time, I like to explore UI/UX design trends, try out new frameworks, and contribute to small projects that challenge me to grow. 
  </p>
  <p>Outside of the world of technology, I enjoy painting, hiking, and traveling. 
    These hobbies give me new perspectives and often inspire my approach to design and development. 
    I see every project as an opportunity not only to apply my current knowledge but also to push myself to learn something new. 
    My ultimate goal is to keep evolving as a developer and to use my skills to create meaningful digital experiences for people all over the world.

  <h2>My Work</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Portfolio Website</strong> – 
      This project is a personal portfolio built to showcase my skills, background, and past projects in one organized place. 
      The design emphasizes simplicity and clarity, with easy navigation that allows visitors to quickly move between sections such as About, Work, Resume, and Contact. 
      The site was built from scratch using only HTML and basic styling techniques to demonstrate that even without complex frameworks, it’s possible to create something clean and effective. 
      The portfolio also features placeholders for multimedia elements like images and video to illustrate the developer’s growth and potential. 
      This project reflects my ability to organize information, create logical structures, and think about user experience at the most basic level.  
      <br>

    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Recipe Finder App</strong> – 
      This project is a web application designed to make cooking easier and more enjoyable for users who may not know exactly what they want to cook. 
      The app allows people to enter the ingredients they already have at home, and based on those ingredients, it suggests a variety of recipes that they can try out. 
      It includes a filtering system that lets users narrow results by preparation time, cuisine type, or dietary restrictions. 
      The goal of this project is not only to save time but also to reduce food waste by helping people use what they already have in their kitchen. 
      In addition, the app has a clean, user-friendly interface with intuitive navigation, making it accessible for people of all ages and cooking skill levels. 
      Overall, this project highlights the importance of combining functionality with thoughtful design to create a tool that solves a common everyday problem.

    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Weather Dashboard</strong> – 
      This project provides users with up-to-date weather information in a clear and visually engaging way. 
      The dashboard pulls live data from a public weather API and displays key details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a short forecast. 
      The design includes icons and color coding to help users quickly interpret weather conditions at a glance. 
      What makes this project particularly useful is its ability to let users search for weather updates in different cities, making it both practical for daily use and a good exercise in working with external APIs. 
      The dashboard represents an important step in connecting front-end design with live data, demonstrating both technical ability and problem-solving skills.  
      <br>

    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Todo List App</strong> – 
      This project is a classic beginner application designed to help users keep track of their daily tasks. 
      The app allows people to add new tasks, mark them as complete, and remove them when they are no longer needed. 
      While the concept is simple, the project demonstrates an understanding of user interaction and data organization, which are essential parts of any real-world application. 
      By keeping the interface minimal, the project focuses on functionality first, ensuring that the app is practical and easy to use. 
      It’s a great example of how even basic projects can teach valuable lessons about structure, flow, and user experience in web development.  
      <br>

    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Travel Blog</strong> – 
      This project is a mock blog site created to display articles, photos, and user comments in a structured and attractive format. 
      It demonstrates how text, images, and multimedia can come together to create engaging content for readers. 
      The site contains placeholder blog posts with titles, dates, and sample text, along with areas reserved for comments and feedback. 
      The goal of the project was to practice laying out content-heavy pages while still maintaining readability and flow. 
      It reflects the importance of planning, organization, and consistency when designing pages that people will actually want to spend time on.
